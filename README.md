# K-means clustering from-sdf file. 


## Molecular Fingerprint Analysis with K-means Clustering

This Python script performs molecular fingerprint analysis using the RDKit library and applies K-means clustering for grouping molecules based on their structural similarities. The resulting clusters are visualized using PCA and the centroids are annotated with molecule names.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- RDKit library (`rdkit`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
- scikit-learn (`scikit-learn`)

## Getting Started

1. Install the required packages

2. Place your SDF file in the same directory as the script.

3. Open the script and set the `target` variable to your target name and configure other parameters if needed.

4. Run the script


## Usage

1. Replace `'KNC'` in the script with your actual target name.

2. Run the script using the instructions provided in the "Getting Started" section.

3. Review the generated plots and the `target-centroids.txt` file for cluster information.
